    Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site. I am currently working towards a certificate in Full Stack Development while also working as an Interactive Designer.
    I received my education in Graphic Design from Pratt Institute and Emmanuel College and have worked as a designer for the past 10 years. I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity
    to work with exciting clients and within teams leading the creative direction on numerous initiatives and campaigns. I've always enjoyed expressing myself creatively and I feel lucky to
    be able to do that everyday in my career. Over the past few years i've been exploring user experience and web development and have worked towards building out those skillsets for my own
    professional development and interest. </p>
    <br>
    <p>If i'm not working, I most enjoy spending time with my two daughters, Camden and Emery. I think it's important that they see their mom work hard and continue to learn and grow. I am passionate
        about women being able to work and learn and to have chances and opportunities to better themselves and their families. I enjoy volunteering and work regularly for Women in Technology, Liberty Encouraging Girls In Tech, 
        HAVEN and Cross Roads House. I also love painting, running and yoga.
